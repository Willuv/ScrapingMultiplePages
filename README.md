This simple python web scraper utilizes BeautifulSoup in order to scrape through a list of movies and print their transcipts to their own separate .txt files. It accomplishes this by grabbing the HTML of the main website, finding the location of the list of movies, following the link each movie provides to their own website, and obtaining the entire transccript to be written elsewhere.
